redefined cabal_macros.h happens. Why?
look into ghc code? why where is a ghc_2.h?
Or see if I can figure out relationships between module trees and redefined warnings?

tmpdir or not is irrelavant.
delete tmp dir or not is irrelavant.

something is wrong in dfsDAG roots.
if import another root, it fails.
maybe i should build a importDAG and get a toposort first.
Now it seems works right.

I use symLinkJoin to bring cabal_macros.h, is it related to the warning?

It turns out I don't need cabal_macros.h now. ghc_??.h has it. What a surprise!

Well, while hoogle get packages names in stackage, I still need to manually add a package I want to try and ghcWith to make the module I am trying to compile. So auto-find-package-by-module cannot totally work.

stderr: error: unrecognised flag '--experimental-features 'ca-derivations''
Try '/run/current-system/sw/bin/nix-build --help' for more information.

maybe add import-parser to nix-freeze-files will acclerate `snack build`
